    <h2>Purpose for this webpage</h2>

<!-- introduction and purpose for webpage -->

    <p>For those who just started programming, the need to know everything there is about the language can be overwhelming and far too common.</p>
    <p>For those who pushed on and became experts, they should be well aware of the difficulties of learning a new language and commiting everything to memory.</p>
    <p>Therefore, I propose the following, if you're an expert in programming or someone who just started learning and is looking for a few examples
    or a cheatsheet of sorts, if you just happened to forgort how to do something, come here and pick up the basics.</p>
    <p>I'm not sure how much attention this will receive, but if you happen to come across this on GitHub, please feel free to add any tips or useful advice on this webpage
    to share with everyone, such as:</p>

    <p>As the title of the webpage suggest, I intend for this to be a guide/cheatsheet that can help people evolve from being a Noob to a Pro.
    I myslef barely know what I am doing, but if you want to track my progress and add your own to the webpage, please feel free to do so.
  Also, don'f forget to either <strong>comment </strong>on the changes you've made so as to <strong>explain </strong>how the code works and why you feel its important, or take a
snippet of your code and post it on GitHub to explain accordingly</p>

<p>Many of the things that I have listed above, I have issues with and I've been trying to learn web programming since 2017 but always gave up because I felt it was too difficult to learn.
I'm a psychology major, so not learning how to program isn't the worst thing for me, but I would love to be able to make my own responsive website, with flask, javascript, APIs
and other stuff that i don't even know about. So let help others who felt like they aren't meant for programming learn.</p>
<p>Let make this webpage a publically available webpage that would serve as <strong>trainingwheels</strong> for StackOverflow, because honestly, i don't know how to use StackOverflow.</p>
