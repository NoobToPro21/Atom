Hello there, I'm not necessarily new to web programming as I have been trying to learn since 2017, but always have had difficulties in doing so.
I created this repository as a means of just storing the basics of html and css so that i can later come back to. 
I hope to add other web programming languages to this respositiory and eventually have this become a full running website. 
I hope to make this website as a cheatsheet of sorts, not only for myself, but for others. A reason why i find web programming so difficult is because, everywhere that teaches it, practically pushes you off a cliff and tell you to learn how to fly.
Sad thing is, I'm lowkey retarded, so those methods of teaching doesn't work for me. Therefore I hope to provide not only myself, but those who also have difficulty learning an easier way to learn.
A central hub for a cheatsheet, in which I hope that i can improve by myself alongside professionals who have helpful advice and strategies for various languages.
I hope to traansform this into a medium that can allow people to quickly go "thats how you use bootstrap, and flask, and python, and make responsive websites, etc.."
I left a longer message in the code and although it is simple right now, let's make this an incredible and responsive website that doesn't throw people off a cliff and tell them to fly.

Thank you ^_^.
